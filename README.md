# python-refresher
Self-review of comp-sci concepts I definitely learned in school. Sometimes details get fuzzy, okay?

Right now, I'm planning on going over design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I might add other things to scope, but not extremely likely.

Each file should be pretty self-contained and I'm going to try not to use any external libraries. That should mean, for example, that you can just call each file like:

```
python3 path/to/file.py
```

and see something happening.
